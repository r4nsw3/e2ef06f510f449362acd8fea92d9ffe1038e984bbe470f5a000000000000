  |                                                                         |

  |   take revenge on the Kingdom of Medius, who destroyed their home and   |
  |   captured the Dragonblood Oracle, Amica. To obtain the power they      |
  |   need to enact their revenge, they forge a pact with the Astral        |
  |   Dragon Atruum.                                                        |

  |   Choose from four playable characters (Empress, Warrior, Shinobi, or   |
  |   Witch) and defeat your enemies to gain experience and level up.       |
  |   You'll receive points as you level up that can increase your attack   |
  |   power, defense, agility, and other parameters. Customize your         |
  |   character in a way that best suits your individual playstyle!         |
  |                                                                         |

  |   world. By strategizing and working together with your party, you'll   |
  |   be able to achieve even greater results and reap even better          |
  |   rewards!                                                              |
